# FilteringReact

## Getting Started

Navigate to the frontend folder in your terminal and execute the following two commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

These commands will install the necessary dependencies for the frontend application and start the development server.

You can then access the application locally by visiting localhost:3000 in your web browser.
